	<content contentuid="GIMB_BookOne_Content" version="1">I am severed. Alone. I do not know who I was before I was myself. 

	I do not know who gave their life that I may be here. I cannot hear the others. I am alone.

	Why do the creatures I see, grovel at my feet? What creature twisted them so? I am alone, even as they praise myself in an unknown tongue.

	I cannot stay here. I am not the myself they see me as. I am in danger. I will flee to the mountain tonight. Perhaps my solitude will shield me.</content>

	<content contentuid="GIMB_BookTwo_Content" version="1">I write this down that another like myself may not feel alone. I found some spellbooks and some paper along the way to this refuge of mine, taken from a traveler with an open head. I do not remember what happened. 
		
	The mountain is quiet. It is decently well hidden. I will write this with my blood.

	I need to find food. I keep remembering the traveler with the open head. My organs tremble with the thought. Dare I consume them? Had I already consumed them, would I know? The mind reels.

	A few hours have passed since my last script. I went back to the traveler and I... I ate her. All that she was in life, I have now preserved after her death. 

	I... or someone that looks like me... killed her. I do not remember the deed. I do not know how long she laid there; bleeding, heart desperately pumping blood to a brain that did not hear it, could not feel it, would not know it. How do you mourn? How do you mourn, even knowing her as I do? Her voice can echo in my thoughts at my command, yet? 

	Can I take away a future and an agency like that? Is that... correct? Why do I not remember it? I must chew on this. No double meaning intended.</content>

	<content contentuid="GIMB_BookThreeContent" version="1">Tear s blot this  ppage. In the  passt few days, my phi1osophical "chewing" has beenn pot on hold, not off  my own accord. I did not know thaat I possessedd the ability of crying, of feelingg this raws scraping against my soul. Day an dnight, I a mwraccked with a sorrrow that feels famil1ar and alIen, an aching lonelliness for a Llife IL do not remembber. I cannnot eat, cannot rest, cannot think- I can only cry out for my lovved onees that I never had, holding emmbraces from people Iive never knowwn, livess mixing and churning accross my mindd.

	Someetimes I wakke up and I am nnot myself. After a ttime, thiss fadess, but is followed byy that hollow pang Ii've come too know so well..

	Peeace. I nneed peacce. Someehow I musst find tthe peacee.
